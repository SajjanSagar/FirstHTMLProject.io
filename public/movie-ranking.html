<h3>Kagaz ke Phool</h3>
<p>This is my favourite Art Movie. I love the real world concepts presentated in the story showing how fake and selfish
    world is.</p>
<h3>Andaz Apna Apna</h3>
<p>Really cool comedy movie.</p>
<h3>the Matrix</h3>
<p>Great special effect with SciFi & philosophical concepts look into human psych.</p>
